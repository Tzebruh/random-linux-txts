first, set up a root fs for the container. the alpine minirootfs from their website is good and will be the example

setup root fs:
$ mkdir container-root
$ tar -xzf /path/to/alpine-minirootfs-x.yy.z-arch.tar.gz --directory container-root

isolate namespaces:
$ unshare -muinprf bash

make root fs into a mount point:
$ mount --bind container_root/ container_root/
$ cd container_root/
note: if you're already in container_root, still run `cd .` because pivot_root doesn't seem to understand that '.' is a mount point if you don't cd to it, i guess it refreshes bash's understanding of . or something, i don't know. this note is the whole reason i made this txt.

pivot root to the root fs:
$ mkdir old_root
$ pivot_root . old_root/
$ cd /

switch to busybox sh:
$ exec /bin/sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/sbin

unmount old root:
$ umount -l old_root/
